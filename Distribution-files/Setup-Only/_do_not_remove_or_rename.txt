When installed using the setup program, Quick Access Popup should be launched using the shortcut
(icon) created in the "Start" menu or in the "Startup" folder. This shortcuts sets the
proper working directory to "C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\QuickAccessPopup" (where the
app config is saved in the quickaccesspopup.ini file).

The current file file helps Quick Access Popup detect that it has been launched directly in the
app folder under the "C:\Program Files" directory (or the directory you selected during
setup). When this situation is detected, the working directory is automatically set to the
proper folder under AppData.
