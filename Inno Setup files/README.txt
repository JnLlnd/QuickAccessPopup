Quick Access Popup
==================

Absolutely free to download and use, for personal or commercial use.


Easy one-step installation
--------------------------

1) Download, execute the quickaccesspopup.exe file and just follow the setup instructions.

2) Enjoy!


Portable installation
---------------------

Follow these instructions if you want to use Quick Access Popup in “portable” mode. This
will, for example, allow you to run it from an external drive or USB key. You’ll just
need to unzip a file.

1) Download quickaccesspopup.zip.

2) There is no software to install. Just extract the zip file content to the folder of your choice.

Note: It is recommended not to install Quick Access Popup in system-protected folders like those
under “C:\Program Files”. This could prevent QAP from saving your configuration.

3) Run the .EXE file from this folder (choose the 32-bits or 64-bits version depending on your
system). Quick Access Popup will create and update the quickaccesspopup.ini file in this folder.
See Quick Access Popup is a Portable App, below.

Note: If an anti-virus or protection software reports Quick Access Popup as a potential threat,
this is not the case. Please read this post: How to stop Anti-virus blocking Folders Popup
(http://code.jeanlalonde.ca/stop-anti-virus-blocking-folders-popup/). This page will later be
adapted to Quick Access Popup but its content is still valid for QAP.

4) At your convenience, create a shortcut on your Desktop or your Start menu or select
"Run at startup" in the Tray menu to launch Quick Access Popup automatically at startup.


Quick Access Popup is a Portable App
------------------------------------

A portable application (portable app), sometimes also called standalone, is a program designed to run on a compatible computer without being installed in a way that modifies the computer’s configuration information. This type of application can be stored on any storage device, including internal mass storage and external storage such as USB drives and floppy disks – storing its program files and any configuration information and data on the storage medium alone (source: Wikipedia).

Specifically, Quick Access Popup does not write any information in the Windows registry or in any system or temporary Windows folder. Running the .EXE file launches Quick Access Popup in its current directory. That’s it! The app creates a temporary subdirectory (named _temp) to store small images and language files required at run time. This folder is deleted when the app quits. The only permanent file created by Quick Access Popup is the QuickAccessPopup.ini file containing your favorites and options.

The file QuickAccessPopup.ico included in this zip file contains the app's icon that you can use to customize the Quick Access Popup's folder or shortcut.
